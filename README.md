During the journey in functional programming,
**PureScript** was picked due to its ability to compile to **JavaScript**
while being 90% similar to **Haskell**.

**Advent of Code** has been useful for consolidating learning and practice,
resulting in the code accumulated in this repository.

Moving forward, **Haskell** will be the more formal choice
for future commitments.
